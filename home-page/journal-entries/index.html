<h2>My Website is a Shifting House & A Rant on Technology </h2>

    <p>Within the context of technology I think that it’s very important to know that we are and aren’t the ones that put the information into the web. Of course in earlier years of the web's life humans were putting all the information in. But, we have gotten to a point in our world that there are sources that put information out from all of the past logs. So with the idea of building a website I think that it's important to build it, and nurture it like it’s a plant. Laurel Schwulst brought up a great point that websites are both the subject and object and we need it to be powered by individuals. Not by bigger corporations or ai. We are the artists, authors, engineers, and builders all in one and we must cherish this power we have. It is a skill that must grow but it’s much more appealing as humans to build a website from the ground up vs something doing it automatically. Moreover, knowing the foundations before jumping into the deep end of design. So it can be more innovative and natural.

<h2>A handmade Web</h2>

    <p>With making websites and the idea of the handmade web. I really appreciate the way J.R. Carpenter explains the ways in which making websites is very similar to the ways in which we create physical media. It’s always growing! It can be whatever you make of it and it’s all up to the artist to create their own handmade web. One quote I particularly liked from the reading is, “It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer.” I like this quote a lot because it details in a meaningful way that websites build new worlds and will always be around.
