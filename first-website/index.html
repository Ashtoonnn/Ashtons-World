        <p>The <a href="https://handmade-web.net/fall25/calendar.html">hand</a> has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Most websites today are built from templates on <i><b>website-building </b></i> platforms, and the knowledge of how to make a website from scratch is relegated to a select few. It has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the <i>perceived requirements and expectations </i>for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.

       <br>
        This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the <em>hand-quality </em> of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and <strong>challenge </strong> what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
